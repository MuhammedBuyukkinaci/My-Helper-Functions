# Important Python Concepts in OOP

1) Inheritance: Using methods and attributes of a parent Class in Child Class

2) Encapsulation: Changing the attribute of a Class only in itself by defining the attributes starting with double underscore __

3) Polymorphism: Being available to send different inputs to a method or a function like Python's built-in len function.

4) Method Overriding: Rewriting a method inherited from a parent class in the Child class.

5) Method Overloading: Calling a method with different number of parameters like we did in C#
